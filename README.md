# MachineLearning

Write a short report evaluating whether the review text can be used to (i) predict the review polarity (where a game has been “voted up” or not by the reviewer) and (ii) predict whether the review is for an “early access” version of a game or not. Hint: Select two or three machine learning approaches, apply them to the dataset and critically evaluate their classification performance. Remember it’s v important to clearly explain/justify any design choices that you make and any conclusions you arrive at. Include any code you use in an appendix.
